<ol>
<li>A programmer is creating an application that requires signed requests (Signature Version 4) for invoking other AWS services. Having constructed a canonical request, created the string to sign, and calculated the signing information, which strategies can the programmer apply to finalize a signed request? (Select TWO.)<ol>
<li>When sending a request to AWS services using Signature Version 4, the signature should be included in the "Authorization" HTTP header or as a parameter "X-Amz-Signature" in the query string.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A Development team has deployed several applications running on an Auto Scaling fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The Operations team have asked for a display that shows a key performance metric for each application on a single screen for monitoring purposes.<ol>
<li>Create a custom namespace with a unique metric name for each application</li>
<li>Explanation: Therefore, the Developer should create a custom namespace with a unique metric name for each application. This namespace will then allow the metrics for each individual application to be shown in a single view through CloudWatch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An application is using Amazon DynamoDB as its data store and needs to be able to read 100 items per second as strongly consistent reads. Each item is 5 KB in size. What value should be set for the table's provisioned throughput for reads?<ol>
<li>To determine the number of RCUs required to handle 100 strongly consistent reads per/second with an average item size of 5KB, perform the following steps:</li>
<li>Determine the average item size by rounding up the next multiple of 4KB (5KB rounds up to 8KB).</li>
<li>Determine the RCU per item by dividing the item size by 4KB (8KB/4KB = 2).</li>
<li>Multiply the value from step 2 with the number of reads required per second (2x100 = 200).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An application uses both Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. The on-premises servers are a critical component of the application, and a developer wants to collect metrics and logs from these servers. The developer would like to use Amazon CloudWatch. How can the developer accomplish this?<ol>
<li>Install the CloudWatch agent on the on-premises servers and specify IAM credentials with permissions to CloudWatch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A Developer is designing a fault-tolerant environment where client sessions will be saved. How can the Developer ensure that no sessions are lost if an Amazon EC2 instance fails?<ol>
<li>Use Amazon DynamoDB to perform scalable session handling</li>
<li>The <strong>DynamoDB Session Handler</strong> is a custom session handler for PHP that allows developers to use Amazon DynamoDB as a session store. Using DynamoDB for session storage alleviates issues that occur with session handling in a distributed web application by moving sessions off of the local file system and into a shared location. DynamoDB is fast, scalable, easy to setup, and handles replication of your data automatically.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An application uses Amazon API Gateway, an AWS Lambda function and a DynamoDB table. The developer requires that another Lambda function is triggered when an item lifecycle activity occurs in the DynamoDB table.<ol>
<li>Enable a DynamoDB stream and trigger the Lambda function synchronously from the stream</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A company uses an Amazon S3 bucket to store a large number of sensitive files relating to eCommerce transactions. The company has a policy that states that all data written to the S3 bucket must be encrypted.<ol>
<li>Create an S3 bucket policy that denies any S3 Put request that does not include the x-amz-server-side-encryption</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An application is being migrated into the cloud. The application is stateless and will run on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The application should scale elastically. How can a Developer ensure that the number of instances available is sufficient for current demand?<ol>
<li>Create a launch configuration and use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A Developer is designing a cloud native application. The application will use several AWS Lambda functions that will process items that the functions read from an event source. Which AWS services are supported for Lambda event source mappings? (Select THREE.)<ol>
<li>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</li>
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li>
<li>Amazon Kinesis</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An engineer is constructing an AWS Lambda function and intends to log specific key events that transpire during the function's execution. To correlate the events with a particular function invocation, the engineer is looking to incorporate a unique identifier. The following code segment has been added to the Lambda function: function handler (event, context) {}<ol>
<li>Use <strong>context.awsRequestId</strong> within the function to fetch the unique identifier associated with each invocation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="question-1-marked">Question 1 (marked)<a class="headerlink" href="#question-1-marked" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A company is implementing an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application needs to process incoming transactions. When the application detects a transaction that is not valid, the application must send a chat message to the company's support team. To send the message, the application needs to retrieve the access token to authenticate by using the chat API.<br />
A developer needs to implement a solution to store the access token. The access token must be encrypted at rest and in transit. The access token must also be accessible from other AWS accounts.<br />
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST management overhead?</p>
<p>C. Use AWS Secrets Manager with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the secret to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Secrets Manager. Retrieve the token from Secrets Manager. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot use a resource-based policy with a parameter in the Parameter Store</p>
<h4 id="question-2">Question 2<a class="headerlink" href="#question-2" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A company is running Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS accounts. A developer needs to implement an application that collects all the lifecycle events of the EC2 instances. The application needs to store the lifecycle events in a single Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in the company's main AWS account for further processing.<br />
Which solution will meet these requirements?</p>
<p>D. Configure the permissions on the main account event bus to receive events from all accounts. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule in each account to send all the EC2 instance lifecycle events to the main account event bus. Add an EventBridge rule to the main account event bus that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Set the SQS queue as a target for the rule</p>
<h4 id="question-3">Question 3<a class="headerlink" href="#question-3" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>An application is using Amazon Cognito user pools and identity pools for secure access. A developer wants to integrate the user-specific file upload and download features in the application with Amazon S3. The developer must ensure that the files are saved and retrieved in a secure manner and that users can access only their own files. The file sizes range from 3 KB to 300 MB.<br />
Which option will meet these requirements with the HIGHEST level of security?</p>
<p>D. Use an IAM policy within the Amazon Cognito identity prefix to restrict users to use their own folders in Amazon S3.</p>
<h4 id="question-4">Question 4<a class="headerlink" href="#question-4" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A company is building a scalable data management solution by using AWS services to improve the speed and agility of development. The solution will ingest large volumes of data from various sources and will process this data through multiple business rules and transformations.<br />
The solution requires business rules to run in sequence and to handle reprocessing of data if errors occur when the business rules run. The company needs the solution to be scalable and to require the least possible maintenance.<br />
Which AWS service should the company use to manage and automate the orchestration of the data flows to meet these requirements?</p>
<p>B. AWS Step Functions</p>
<h4 id="question-5">Question 5<a class="headerlink" href="#question-5" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A developer has created an AWS Lambda function that is written in Python. The Lambda function reads data from objects in Amazon S3 and writes data to an Amazon DynamoDB table. The function is successfully invoked from an S3 event notification when an object is created. However, the function fails when it attempts to write to the DynamoDB table.<br />
What is the MOST likely cause of this issue?</p>
<p>C. The Lambda function does not have IAM permissions to write to DynamoDB.</p>
<h4 id="question-6">Question 6<a class="headerlink" href="#question-6" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A developer is creating an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy Amazon EC2 instances across multiple AWS accounts. The developer must choose the EC2 instances from a list of approved instance types.<br />
How can the developer incorporate the list of approved instance types in the CloudFormation template?</p>
<p>D. In the CloudFormation template, create a parameter with the list of EC2 instance types as AllowedValues.</p>
<h4 id="question-7">Question 7<a class="headerlink" href="#question-7" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A developer has an application that makes batch requests directly to Amazon DynamoDB by using the BatchGetItem low-level API operation. The responses frequently return values in the UnprocessedKeys element.<br />
Which actions should the developer take to increase the resiliency of the application when the batch response includes values in UnprocessedKeys? (Choose two.)</p>
<p>B. Retry the batch operation with exponential backoff and randomized delay.
D. Increase the provisioned read capacity of the DynamoDB tables that the operation accesses.</p>
<h4 id="question-8">Question 8<a class="headerlink" href="#question-8" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A company is running a custom application on a set of on-premises Linux servers that are accessed using Amazon API Gateway. AWS X-Ray tracing has been enabled on the API test stage.<br />
How can a developer enable X-Ray tracing on the on-premises servers with the LEAST amount of configuration?</p>
<p>B. Install and run the X-Ray daemon on the on-premises servers to capture and relay the data to the X-Ray service.</p>
<h4 id="question-9">Question 9<a class="headerlink" href="#question-9" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>

<p>A developer wants to expand an application to run in multiple AWS Regions. The developer wants to copy Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with the latest changes and create a new application stack in the destination Region. According to company requirements, all AMIs must be encrypted in all Regions. However, not all the AMIs that the company uses are encrypted.<br />
How can the developer expand the application to run in the destination Region while meeting the encryption requirement?</p>
<p>A. Create new AMIs, and specify encryption parameters. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region. Delete the unencrypted AMIs.</p>
<p>Note: The best solution for meeting the encryption requirement is to create new AMIs with encryption enabled and copy them to the destination Region. By default, when an AMI is copied to another Region, it is not encrypted in the destination Region even if it is encrypted in the source Region. Therefore, the developer must create new encrypted AMIs that can be used in the destination Region. Once the new encrypted AMIs have been created, they can be copied to the destination Region. The unencrypted AMIs can then be deleted to ensure that all instances running in all Regions are using only encrypted AMIs.</p>

<p>A developer needs to migrate an online retail application to AWS to handle an anticipated increase in traffic. The application currently runs on two servers: one server for the web application and another server for the database. The web server renders webpages and manages session state in memory. The database server hosts a MySQL database that contains order details. When traffic to the application is heavy, the memory usage for the web server approaches 100% and the application slows down considerably.<br />
The developer has found that most of the memory increase and performance decrease is related to the load of managing additional user sessions. For the web server migration, the developer will use Amazon EC2 instances with an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer.<br />
Which additional set of changes should the developer make to the application to improve the application's performance?</p>
