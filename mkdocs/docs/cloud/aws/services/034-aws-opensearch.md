# Amazon OpenSearch Service

## Overview

Amazon OpenSearch Service (formerly Amazon Elasticsearch Service) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, secure, and operate OpenSearch and Elasticsearch clusters at scale.

## Key Features
- Managed OpenSearch and Elasticsearch clusters
- Real-time search, analytics, and visualization
- Integrated with Kibana and OpenSearch Dashboards
- Secure with encryption, IAM, and VPC support
- Automated backups, patching, and monitoring
- Scalable storage and compute

## Use Cases
- Log and event data analysis
- Full-text search
- Application monitoring and observability
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Business analytics

## Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- IAM-based access control
- VPC support for network isolation
- Fine-grained access control

## Monitoring & Logging
- Integrated with CloudWatch for metrics and alarms
- Slow log publishing for search and indexing
- Audit logs for compliance

## Best Practices
- Use VPC endpoints for secure access
- Monitor cluster health and set up alerts
- Enable automated snapshots for backups
- Use fine-grained access control for multi-tenant environments
- Scale clusters based on workload

## Indexes

Indexes in OpenSearch are similar to tables in a relational database or collections in MongoDB. They organize documents and make it easy to perform searches.

### Key Concepts:

- **Document**: A basic unit of information that can be indexed. It is expressed in JSON format.
- **Index**: A collection of documents with similar characteristics. Each index has a unique name.
- **Shards**: Indices are split into shards to distribute data across multiple nodes for scalability and parallel processing.
- **Replicas**: Copies of shards that provide redundancy and increase availability.
