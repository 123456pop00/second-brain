# AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

## Overview

AWS SAM is an open-source framework for building serverless applications on AWS. It provides shorthand syntax to define functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings in a single template.

## Key Features
- Simplifies serverless application development
- Uses AWS CloudFormation as the underlying deployment engine
- Supports local development and testing
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines
- Built-in best practices for security and monitoring

## Components
- AWS::Serverless::Function: Defines a Lambda function
- AWS::Serverless::Api: Defines an API Gateway
- AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable: Defines a DynamoDB table
- AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion: Defines a Lambda layer

## Development Workflow
1. Write your application code
2. Define resources in the SAM template (template.yaml)
3. Build and test locally using the SAM CLI
4. Deploy to AWS using the SAM CLI or CI/CD pipeline

## Local Development
- Use `sam local invoke` to run Lambda functions locally
- Use `sam local start-api` to test API Gateway locally
- Supports Docker for emulating Lambda runtime

## Deployment
- Use `sam deploy` to deploy serverless applications
- Supports change sets and rollback
- Integrates with AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Separate dev, test, and prod environments
- Monitor functions with CloudWatch
- Use IAM roles with least privilege
- Test locally before deploying to production
