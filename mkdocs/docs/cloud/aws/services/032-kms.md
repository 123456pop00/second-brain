# Key Management Service (KMS)

## Overview
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
- AWS manages encryption keys for you
- Integrated with IAM for authorization
- Control access to your data
- Audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail
- Integrated into most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM, etc.)

## Encryption Types
- **Symmetric (AES-256):**
  - Single encryption key for encrypt and decrypt
  - Used by most AWS services integrated with KMS
- **Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pair):**
  - Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
  - Used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations
  - Public key is downloadable, private key is not

## KMS Key Types
- AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB
- AWS Managed Key (free): (e.g., aws/rds)
- Customer managed keys created in KMS: $1/month
- Customer managed keys imported (must be symmetric): $1/month

## Key Rotation
- AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year
- Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year
- Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation (using alias)

## Key Policies
- Control access to KMS keys (similar to S3 bucket policies)
- Required for access control
- Allow cross-account access (e.g., for snapshots)
- Default KMS Key Policy: full access to root user (entire AWS account)
- Custom KMS Key Policy: define users/roles for access and administration, useful for cross-account access

## API Summary
- **Encrypt:** encrypt up to 4 KB of data through KMS
- **GenerateDataKey:** generates a unique symmetric data key (DEK), returns plaintext and encrypted copy
- **GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext:** generate a DEK (encrypted only, must use Decrypt later)
- **Decrypt:** decrypt up to 4 KB of data (including Data Encryption Keys)
- **GenerateRandom:** returns a random byte string

## Envelope Encryption
- KMS Encrypt API call limit: 4 KB
- For >4 KB, use Envelope Encryption
- Use GenerateDataKey API to get a plaintext data key and an encrypted data key
- Encrypt: use plaintext data key to encrypt your file, store encrypted data key with the file
- Decrypt: use KMS to decrypt the encrypted data key, then decrypt your file
