# AWS Athena

AWS Athena is a **serverless**, interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.

---

## Overview

- **Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage; run queries directly on data stored in Amazon S3 without complex ETL processes.
- **Based on Presto**: Uses Presto, an open-source distributed SQL query engine, for high-speed data querying.
- **SQL Queries**: Supports ANSI SQL, making it easy for users familiar with SQL to get started quickly.
- **Integrations**: Works seamlessly with AWS services such as Glue (data cataloging), IAM (security), and CloudTrail (auditing).
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to execute queries in parallel for fast performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Formats**: Supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet.
- **Data Lake**: Query data in data lakes, enabling big data analytics without loading data into a database.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the queries you run, billed by the amount of data scanned.
- **Catalog Integration**: Integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog for unified metadata across services.
- **Security**: Uses AWS IAM for fine-grained access control and secure querying.
- **Audit & Compliance**: Queries can be logged and monitored using AWS CloudTrail for compliance and auditing.

## Best Practices

- **Partitioning**: Partition S3 data to reduce the amount of data scanned, improving performance and lowering costs.
- **Compression**: Use compressed formats (Parquet, ORC) to minimize storage costs and speed up queries.
- **Optimize File Sizes**: Balance between too many small files and a few very large files for optimal performance.
- **Schema Design**: Design schemas carefully, considering query patterns to optimize performance.
