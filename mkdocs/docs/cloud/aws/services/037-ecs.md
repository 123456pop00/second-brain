# Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

## Overview

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Docker containers on AWS.

## Key Features
- Fully managed container orchestration
- Supports Docker containers
- Works with EC2 and AWS Fargate launch types
- Integrated with AWS networking and security
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Auto scaling and rolling updates

## Architecture
- Clusters: Logical grouping of tasks or services
- Tasks: Instantiation of a task definition (one or more containers)
- Services: Maintain desired number of running tasks
- Task Definitions: Blueprint for your application (container images, CPU, memory, networking, IAM roles)
- Launch Types: EC2 (user-managed) or Fargate (serverless)

## Security
- IAM roles for tasks and services
- VPC integration for network isolation
- Security groups and network ACLs
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## Monitoring & Logging
- Integrated with CloudWatch for metrics and logs
- Container-level monitoring and logging

## Best Practices
- Use IAM roles for least privilege
- Monitor resource usage and set up alerts
- Use VPC and security groups for isolation
- Optimize task definitions for cost and performance

## Task Placement Strategies

Amazon ECS supports the following task placement strategies:

**binpack** - Place tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory. This minimizes the number of instances in use.

**random** - Place tasks randomly.

**spread** - Place tasks evenly based on the specified value. Accepted values are instanceId (or host, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as attribute:ecs.availability-zone. Service tasks are spread based on the tasks from that service. Standalone tasks are spread based on the tasks from the same task group.
